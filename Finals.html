		<h2>Project Difficulties</h2>
		<p>
		This happened to be the second most frustrating project to do because the problem was simple, but it had a hard solution. I wanted the user to respond in a certain time frame to create tension in this story, and I had to ask for help multiple times, and ended up using lines of code I did not know how to use yet. But in the end, it all worked out.
